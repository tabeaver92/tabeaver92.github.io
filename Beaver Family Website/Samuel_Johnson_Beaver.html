                <p><strong>Samuel Johnson <em>"Johns"</em> Beaver</strong> (<em> 11 April, 1826 - 1882 </em>) was prominent & prolific member of the Beaver family, known for being the father of at least 19 children. A son of Martin van Buren Beaver, Sr., he was the older brother of historic frontiersman <a href="Wilson_Asbury_Beaver.html">Wilson Asbury Beaver, Sr.</a>. He was born in North Carolina, but moved in his early childhood with the rest of his family to Tennessee in about 1835, at the prompting of his father Martin. Martin died in 1839 at the age of 39, leaving behind his young family. Like many other members of the Beaver family, Samuel eventually moved to his brother Wilson's land in northern Arkansas, though he settled in Barry County, Missouri, around Seligman.</p>
                <p>Around 1842, while still living in Tennessee, Samuel met Mary Cargyle while working for her father James. The two married, and shortly thereafter began to have children, the first of whom was Martin Asbury Beaver. They would eventually have 10 or 11 children together. They remained together in Tennessee until about 1853, when they moved to Barry County, Missouri. While in Barry County, Samuel likely met his second wife Adaline McGuffey while still living with Mary Cargyle. On the 22nd of July, 1863, Samuel enlisted with the Union 2nd Arkansas Cavalry, and served in both Company G and Company M during the American Civil War. It is likely that he fought in numerous battles against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price%27s_Missouri_Expedition" target="_blank">Price's Missouri Expedition</a>, a failed Confederate invasion of Missouri. Samuel's sons Martin and James both fought alongside him in the 2nd Arkansas Cavalry.</p>
                <p>Samuel was honorably discharged from military service at the end of the war, on August 20th, 1865. After the war, its said that he never returned to his wife Mary, but rather ran off with a much younger girl. Samuel and Mary never got an official divorce, later qualifying her for a widower's pension when he died. With his new "wife" Adaline, Samuel started a nother family, ultimately fathering another 9 children. They moved to Eureka Springs, Arkansas, not far from Beaver. Adaline died young in 1879, possibly while pregnant with yet another child.. Samuel died a few short years later in 1882 of unknown causes. His youngest son, Allen, was just 5 years old.</p>
