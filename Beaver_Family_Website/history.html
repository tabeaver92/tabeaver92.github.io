                <h3>A word on origins . . .</h3>
                <p>The <strong>Beaver</strong> family came to America some time in the mid-1700s. The first verifiable Beaver ancestor in the Americas was <strong>James Caleb Beaver</strong>, whose father (<em>James Richard Beaver</em>) lived and died in England and was buried at Cripplesgate Chapel in London, and whose son (<em>Martin Caleb Beaver</em>) fought in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution" target="_blank">American Revolution</a>. The name, however, had already existed for many centuries, and has a variety of potential origins.</p>
                <p>It may have been a nickname referring to a hard worker, or to someone who was believed to bare a resemblance to the animal, derived from the Middle English word "<em>bevere</em>" or the Old English (pre-7th century) word "<em>beofor</em>", both meaning "<em>beaver</em>". For those who are hesitant to make a connection to some form of nobility which cannot be verified, this may be the preferred origin. Most people before the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution" target="_blank">Industrial Revolution</a> were farmers and laborers with little wealth or social mobility.</p>
                <p>Alternatively, the name may be of Norman origin. This applies to variants of the name including <em>Beaver, Beever, Beevor, Bevar, Bever, Bevir, Biever</em> and others. In this case, it derives from a number of Norman location names in France called <em>Beauvoir</em> or <em>Belvoir</em>, in areas of Normandy such as Somme, Manche, and Seine-Maritime. This variant of the name derives from the Old French words "<em>beu, bel</em>" (meaning "fair" or "lovely") and "<em>veir, voir</em>" (meaning "to see" or "view"), or "<em>a place with a nice view"</em>. These very earliest of Beaver ancestors from Normandy were granted lands in Berkshire, England by their liege lord, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_the_Conqueror" target="_blank">William the Conqueror</a>, for their aid in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Hastings" target="_blank">Battle of Hastings</a>.</p>
                <h3>Asbury . . .</h3>
                <p>A name which appears frequently in the Beaver family across generations and branches is <strong>Asbury</strong>. The precise origin of this name within the family is not yet known, but its etymology is clearly understood. Asbury is an English locational name, derived from a place in Cheshire known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astbury,_Cheshire" target="_blank">Astbury.</a> The name first appears in 12th century records as "<em>Esteburi</em>" and "<em>Asteburi</em>", deriving from the Old English word for "east" and the word "<em>burh</em>", meaning a fortified town. It therefore referred to "a fortified town to the east".</p>
                <p>Known Beavers with the name Asbury (sometimes spelled "<em>Ashberry</em>") are as follows (in order of birth):</p>
