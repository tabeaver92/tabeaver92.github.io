                    <h3>About the author . . .</h3>
                    <p>My name is <strong>Timothy Aaron Beaver</strong>. I'm a graduate from the University of Central Missouri with a BS in Psychology & Writing for Publications. This website is the beginning of my journey into the world of website development & design. In January of 2020, I became deeply interested in my family history. Utilizing the vast databanks available on the Ancestry site, as well as a great deal of help from my extended family, I managed to piece together a story of businessmen, town builders, frontiersmen, veterans and horse thieves. I was blessed to discovered that my ancestry is one filled with interesting tales. I made it my mission to make sure their stories were remembered and shared, as a means of honoring them.</p>
                    <p>I enjoy writing stories, a skill that has helped me throughout my life. In my free time, I'm writing a series of Science-Fiction Adventure novels which I hope to have published before too long. I also like hiking with my dog, reading & researching, and spending time with my family. My knowledge of web development is entirely self-taught.</p>
                    <p>If you're interested to know more about the Beavers, hiring me to design your own website, or otherwise contacting me, please send a straightforward and to-the-point email to tabeaver92@gmail.com, and I will get back to you as quickly as possible.</p>
