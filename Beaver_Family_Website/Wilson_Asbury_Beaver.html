                <p><strong>Wilson Asbury <em>"Squire"</em> Beaver</strong> (<em>June 7, 1831 - May 13, 1915</em>) was an important frontiersman and settler in the early Arkansas Territory, and the most prominent member of the Beaver family. The fourth child of Martin van Buren Beaver, Sr. and Christine Pendergrass, Wilson was born in Macon County, North Carolina. The Beaver family moved to Coffee County, Tennessee in the 1835, where Wilson spent most of his formative years. His father Martin died at the young age of 39 in 1839, leaving behind his wife and five young children. In 1851, Wilson married Rhoda Emeline Waits of Tennessee, with whom he would go on to have 10 children.</p>
                <p>In 1857, Wilson and Rhoda purchased 348 acres alongside the White River from John and Sarah Williams, who had previously acquired it from the US government. Wilson shortly thereafter moved his wife and young children to his new land and constructed a home. He then built a ferry station to aid travellers and fellow settlers in crossing the White River. Settlers would pass through Beaver's land on their way west, to settlements such as Eureka Springs and Seligman. A town began to grow around Wilson's home, which became known as "Beaver's Ferry". Later in 1857, shortly after Wilson and his wife settled in the area, a huge train of 40 wagons and 1000 heads of cattle and horse crossed the White River using Beaver's ferry. Likely the largest such crossing Beaver's Ferry ever saw, this wagon train was headed to California under the leadership of Alexander Fancher. The wagon train was destroyed and its people slaughtered in southern Utah, in the infamous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker%E2%80%93Fancher_party">Mountain Meadows Massacre.</a></p>
                <p>Wilson was a staunch supporter of the Democratic Party. In 1862, he used his home as a hospital for wounded Confederate soldiers, and it became known as the "Old Confederate House". In 1864, he served 6 months in the 6th Missouri Regiment of the Confederate Army. He was released early due to hardship at home. One of his brothers, likely Henry Miles Beaver, was killed by Federal troops. The story goes that Wilson's wife was forced to cook the family's milk cow to feed supper to a band of Bushwackers. On leaving, they dragged Henry from the home for "questioning". He was later found by Rhoda and another woman from town hanging from a tree, just a few miles away. Despite this injustice, Wilson was known to later house Union soldiers in his home, as well as Confederate troops retreating from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Pea_Ridge">Battle of Pea Ridge</a>. The Beaver family was starkly split by the Civil War, with other members of the family fighting for the Union. Wilson's brother Samuel, and two of Samuel's sons (Martin and James), served together in the 2nd Arkansas Cavalry.</p>
                <p>Beaver's Ferry was incorporated into Carroll County in 1869, and on September 22nd, 1879, the Beaver Ferry Post Office was established, with Wilson serving as the first Postmaster. This post office was closed in March 1880, but a stagecoach line was established using "Beaver's Station" as a stop-over, where Wilson kept fresh horses for the journey. On October 3rd, 1881, the post office was reopened, this time with the town's name shortened to just "Beaver". Wilson had by this time become an honored elder member of the community, and was named Justice of the Peace. He held court in his home, officiated marriages, preached funerals, and donated land to create Beaver Cemetery, where he was later buried.</p>
                <p>A large stone quarry was established on Wilson's land which employed 400 laborers and produced cross-grained cream-colored magnesian limestone. Stone from the Beaver Quarry was used to construct the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crescent_Hotel_(Eureka_Springs,_Arkansas)">Crescent Hotel</a> in Eureka Springs and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_County_Courthouse-Fort_Smith_City_Hall">Sebastian County Courthouse</a>, among other buildings. A railroad was constructed which passed through Beaver, connecting Seligman, Missouri to Eureka Springs, Arkansas. This railroad stood until about 1950, when a flood knocked it down, though remnants of it still stand.</p>
                <p>Wilson died in 1915, however he continued to influence the area posthumously. In 1949 a suspension bridge was built at Beaver allowing motorists to cross the White River. Called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaver_Bridge_(Arkansas)">Beaver Bridge</a> or the "Little Golden Gate Bridge", the bridge is the only suspension bridge open to the public in Arkansas, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. A dam called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaver_Lake_(Arkansas)#Beaver_Dam">Beaver Dam</a> was constructed about 6 miles upriver from Beaver in the 1960s, which created <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaver_Lake_(Arkansas)">Beaver Lake</a>, a popular tourist destination and retirement area.</p>
