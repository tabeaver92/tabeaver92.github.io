            <h3>An introduction . . .</h3>
            <p>The <strong>Beavers</strong> are a historic American family, known for their role in settling the early Arkansas Territory. Builders, town founders, veterans, and developers of the wild lands of a newly conquered continent, the Beavers have always been intelligent, resourceful, and productive people. Originally from England, <strong>James Caleb Beaver</strong> settled in North Carolina some time in the mid-18th century. His son, <strong>Martin Caleb Beaver</strong>, went on to fight in the Revolutionary War alongside the likes of Abraham Martinsen van Buren.</p>
            <p>While the circumstances of their arrival to the Americas is not fully understood, it can be surmised that they were independently wealthy, likely the owners and operators of stores or the providers of trade skills. As veterans of most of the United States' early wars, the Beavers rapidly ascended among the ranks of early American society. By the third generation, a young <strong>William Martin Beaver</strong> married Rebecca Hardcastle, a daughter of Elisha Hardcastle and Mary van Buren, who was herself the aunt of <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Van_Buren" target="_blank">Martin van Buren</a></em>, the future 8th President of the United States. They named their son <strong>Martin van Buren Beaver</strong>, a namesake of both the van Buren patriarch (Martin Pietersen van Buren) and his Beaver father and grandfather.</p>
            <p>The Beavers slowly moved westward over the following decades, first settling in Coffee County, Tennessee. One of Martin van Buren Beaver's sons, <a href="/Beaver_Family_Website/Wilson_Asbury_Beaver.html"><strong>Wilson Asbury <em>"Squire"</em> Beaver</strong><a></a>, acquired roughly 450 acres in the untamed Arkansas Territory around the year 1850, in what would one day become Carroll County, Arkansas. He settled alongside the White River, and built a ferry station to help travellers cross the river. He also built a post office, an inn, and numerous other buildings which still remain in the area. His small settlement became known as "<em>Beaver's Ferry</em>", and eventually just "<em>Beaver</em>". Wilson Beaver became a historic figure in the area, with a famous bridge, a dam, and a beautiful lake named after him in addition to the small town. Wilson and many other members of the Beaver family would fight in the American Civil War on both sides of the conflict, with Wilson's home becoming known as the "<em>Confederate House</em>". Over time, most of the extended Beaver family moved west from North Carolina and Tennessee to join Wilson in his new settlement.</p>

            <p>Another of Martin van Buren Beaver's children, <a href="/Beaver_Family_Website/Samuel_Johnson_Beaver.html"><strong>Samuel Johnson <em>"Johns"</em> Beaver</strong></a>, had 19 children with 2 women, in Arkansas and Missouri. His oldest son, <strong>Martin Asbury <em>"Mart"</em> Beaver</strong>, would go on to found the small town of Manson, Arkansas, just south of Pocahontas, where he would operate a small general goods store. He married Polina Jane Wheeler, with whom he had two sons, James Arthur Beaver, and <strong>William Marvin <em>"Willie"</em> Beaver</strong>. Willie went on to marry Isabelle Marie Carter, also of Arkansas, with whom he moved to the St Louis area of Missouri. Together, they had three sons, William Fremont "<em>Bill</em>" Beaver, Rex Howard Beaver, and Robert Joseph "<em>Bob</em>" Beaver.</p>
            <p>After serving in the navy during World War II, <strong>Bill Beaver</strong> (who at the time went by the name "<em>Fremont</em>") came home and started a family with Grace Ann Johnson of St Louis. He made money as one of the first classic car salesmen in America, buying, refurbishing, and then selling Ford Model Ts to collectors and other prospective buyers. A consummate salesman and businessman with a knack for resourcefulness, Bill Beaver eventually acquired several hundred acres around Marthasville, Missouri, and moved his large family out into the country with him. He became a land developer, using his large swathes of land as inventory for his business and building numerous lakes with which he enticed families to buy land from him. Among other accomplishments, Fremont helped establish a route for tourists in the area and funded the reconstruction of historical buildings in the Marthasville area related to the famous frontiersman <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Boone" target="_blank">Daniel Boone.</a></em></p>
